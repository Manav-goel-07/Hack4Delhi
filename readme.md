# 🗳️ ONE-VOTE

### *Clarity, not chaos. Democracy, not noise.*

> **Hack4Delhi 2026 Submission**
> A civic-tech platform designed to educate, engage, and empower citizens around the concept of **One Nation One Election (ONOE)** while actively countering misinformation — without political bias.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Modern democracies face two parallel crises:

1. **Information Overload** – Citizens are exposed to fragmented, sensational, and often misleading political content.
2. **Low Civic Understanding** – Complex constitutional ideas like *One Nation One Election* are reduced to slogans, not explanations.

As a result, public opinion is often shaped by virality instead of verified knowledge.

**The challenge:**
👉 *How can we explain ONOE in a neutral, engaging, and trustworthy way while resisting misinformation?*

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**ONE-VOTE** is an interactive, education-first web platform that breaks down One Nation One Election into:

* Clear explanations
* Visual narratives
* Interactive learning modules

Instead of telling users *what to think*, we help them understand *how things work*.

No propaganda. No persuasion. Only clarity.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

For democracy to function:

* Citizens must understand policies
* Disagreement must be informed
* Technology must reduce noise, not amplify it

**ONE-VOTE** aims to be a digital public square built on facts, not frenzy.
